## Feedback Notes for Professor Borland

The process we took was to prototype out each singular section of our workflow. This is why the code we are providing you is provided in separate features. This method of testing allowed us to understand how each feature performs on its own and in combination with another. We connected this experience though a [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/q7kQQcfiHid6iF1w5r23lj/Build-A-Beat?node-id=363%3A43&viewport=-1782%2C2744%2C0.5030785799026489&scaling=scale-down) when testing with our users.

<b>Features:</b>
- Initial generation and regeneration tool based on a mutation GA with two preset parameters and three variable parameters.
- A mutation tool that randomizes the final beat's properties. 
- An additional prototype at its beginning phase of how we might start adding melodies to the beats and control how they are layered.

We’d especially like feedback on our genetic algorithm and any recommendations you might have to optimize the way we are generating beats and mutating them based on our parameters. We’re currently working on testing the performance of our genetic algorithm based on various inputs to evaluate the variety of options it can produce, and strike a balance between control and randomness. The default randomness is on the lower side of things just due to our target user being a novice - the purpose being to progressively introduce the user to experimental and more complex settings.



-------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
